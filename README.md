# Step 1: Data
Say we have a stream of data bits that we want to transmit. Using digital modulation schemes, we first design 'symbols' for each data. In QAM, these symbols correspond to points with both real and imaginary parts, and an 'IQ' (In-phase and Quadrature) diagram is used to display the 'constellation' of a QAM format.
